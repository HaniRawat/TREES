# TREES

Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions related to trees. Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, characterized by their hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes. I am using the Coder Army Sheet for these questions[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pud-vdSPhhljScynHvTUGRE5yxEV6dCMb45rOwoSt_Q/edit#gid=0]
